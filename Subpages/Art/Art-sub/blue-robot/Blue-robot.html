       The name of this project is a bit too racist don't you think?
       <br>
       Well, okay, let me add a pink robot tooðŸ¤¡.<br>
       haha enough with the jokes.<br> So I made this robot as a character for a music video for a friend, but she didn't finish the song, but I finished the video and I just don't feel right putting it up, so if you want to see it, contact me at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rhysjosmin/">@rhysjosmin</a> 
       on Instagram. <br><br> This project was about two robots meeting each other and falling in love.<br><br>  Yeah, I know, not really realistic, but ehh, as much as I like a good story, I'm also lazy and like to get stuff finished fast and start doing something else instead.<br><br>  I got the models ready in less than an hour, used the riggify addon to rig them, and I was on my way. To animate it, I had to use a lot of references. The thing about animating it was that it was my first time doing such a large project (about 3-mins).<br>It was a pain. <br><br> but the result was beautifull and thats all that matters in life i guess you can say<br><br> 
       its about the destination and not the journey ....hmmm dejavu
