        Hmm.. so how do i start this note.
        <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Okay, so one day i stumbled over a random youtuber with about maybe 50 or so subscribers,i watched some of his videos to show community support,as you should,and i stumbled over his discord channel,it had maybe 20 people in it,so i join this channel and i dont open discord for a few weeks,and then randomly i open discord when i was about to sleep and i see this message of a Challenge, the challenge was to make the most cinematic render and so i go forth and do this challenge, i was queit young in 3d Art, a newbie you can say,so  i start with a simple idea <span style="color:rgb(68, 68, 68);">|sillohete of a man in front of a window|</span> to make the man i use mc prep , an addon that just directly creates minecraft models and the rest is pretty self explanatory
