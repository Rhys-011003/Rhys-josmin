        This was one of the cutest projects I've ever worked on. This project began as a birthday gift for a friend,but as time went on it found its way never reaching her. I learned a few things from this project, such as how large eyes make a cute character. I also discovered that hair is a pain to deal with; it gets everywhere (I learnt this by having long hair but hehe) Thankfully, the new viewport denoiser made things faster.<br><br>While rendering and testing i was wondering what absurd thing i can add to it so it becomes my own and not a generic cute pic so i was like darth vader... Heck Yeah, halo... Obviously<br><br> And i give you <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CWnOV_YIMmL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Darth Theodore</a> ???
